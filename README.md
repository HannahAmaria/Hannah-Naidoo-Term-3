# Concept Process

I went with a simple and minimalistic UI design. Batch is where users can view and purchase various Apple Watch Bands as well as add their own in a quick, concise, and effective way. I used a simple white and black colour palette that will make it easy for users to naviagte through.

## Ideation

I wanted to create a simple website where users can buy Apple Watch Bands.

# Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

## Implementation Process

- I used `npx create-react app` to create this React project. I implemented component-based development instead of classes. By doing this, I will be able to easily inject and eject components and sub-components into my project, making it refactorable and reusable instead of writing up classes I have to do every time making it tedious and redundant

- I obeyed the `saas` styling of my project which is slightly different from `scss` as the manner in which indentation has been applied is important and semi-colons are not allowed 

- `Axios` was implemented so that I can make HTTP requests to the BallDontLie API so that I can dynamically display these datasets on a magic chart called charts.js version 5

### Highlights

- The login, sign up and cart functionality was quite easy to implement
- ChatGPT made the workload easier

### Challenges

- Login authentication took quite a bit of time
- User permission that allowed admins to dispatch orders

## Future Implementation

- I would have loved to spend more time working on the front end design
